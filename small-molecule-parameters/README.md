Parameter library


Parameters for a few small molecules and ions, that are commonly seen as cobinders in protein-ligand systems. For each molecule, a .mol2 file and an .frcmod file are provided, which are needed for Antechamber's tleap to build the solvated systems. For more information regarding cobinders, see the BAT User Guide.
